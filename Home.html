			<h1> Welcome to Starbucks®</h1>
		
			<p> 
				Since 1971, <span class="green">Starbucks</span> Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting the highest quality arabica coffee in the world. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p> 
			 	We started roasting coffee in 1971, and it was the way we approached our craft that created so many <span class="green">Starbucks</span> fans in those early days. Our coffee stood out not only because it was darker, but also because it had more flavor.
