			<p> 
				To say <span class="green">Starbucks</span> purchases and roasts high-quality
				 whole bean coffees is very true. That's the essence of what we do
				  – but it hardly tells the whole story.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p> 
			 	Our coffeehouses have become a beacon for coffee lovers everywhere.
			 	 Why do they insist on <span class="green">Starbucks</span>? Because they know they can count 
			 	 on genuine service, an inviting atmosphere and a superb cup of 
			 	 expertly roasted and richly brewed coffee every time.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>
			 	We're not just passionate purveyors of coffee, but everything else
			 	 that goes with a full and rewarding coffeehouse experience. We 
			 	 also offer a selection of premium Tazo® teas, fine pastries and 
			 	 other delectable treats to please the taste buds. And the music 
			 	 you hear in store is chosen for its artistry and appeal.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>
			 	It's not unusual to see people coming to <span class="green">Starbucks</span> to chat, meet 
			 	up or even work. We're a neighborhood gathering place, a part 
			 	of the daily routine – and we couldn't be happier about it. 
			 	Get to know us and you'll see: we are so much more than what 
			 	we brew.
