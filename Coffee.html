			<h3> Blonde Roast Coffees </h3>
			<p> 
				<span class="green">Starbucks</span> has reimagined how to bring a lighter taste to our 
				coffees. Our 40 year history of sourcing, roasting, and blending 
				the highest quality coffee in the world allowed us to create a
				 recipe that yield sa great-tasting, perfectly balanced cup of 
				 light roast coffee. This is Starbucks first true light roast
				  coffee. The name “Starbucks® Blonde Roast” reflects our roasting
				   artistry and indicates a coffee that is light bodied and
				    flavorful – our easiest-drinking coffee.

			 <h3> Dark Roast Coffees </h3>
			 <p> 
			 Since 1971, we have celebrated the art of the dark roast. From our 
			 stout and refined <span class="green">Starbucks®</span> Gold Coast Blend® to our intense 
			 <span class="green">Starbucks®</span> French Roast—the darkest we can roast—these coffees are 
			 treasured for their robust flavors and lush mouthfeel.
